There were nice moments with Teddy like when he rode his fixed up bike for the first time in a year --- seeing the job of accomplishment in his eyes despite fear of riding. Then more errands / chores when I got home. Was nice to get into the coding vibe, but quickly found a slog of bugs and vibe coding challenges with ChatGPT/5. Felt good to get a v2 of the orion-vision service completed and logging action!",
