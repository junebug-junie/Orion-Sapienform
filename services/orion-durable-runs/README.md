# orion-durable-runs

Durable, resumable cognition runs, kicked off from cortex. Step 3 of the
attention-schema-surface ordering; design and evidence in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-durable-cognition-runs-from-cortex-design.md`.

**What it does, in one sentence:** a curiosity investigation (Orion's longest act
of cognition, 10-40 minutes) used to live entirely in Hub's process memory and died
with every Hub redeploy; now its state machine lives here under a Postgres
checkpointer, a restart of Hub or of this service resumes the run at its next
node with the same `run_id`, and cortex sees every kickoff.

## Flow

```
Hub tick (scheduling, material, worldview, prompt)
  -> orion:cortex:request  (context.metadata.durable_run = DurableRunRequestV1)
  -> orion-cortex-orch dispatches -> orion:durable:run:request   (this service, single consumer)
  -> graph: harness_turn -> read_turn_result -> publish_attention_row -> journal -> finish
       harness_turn = RPC back to Hub on orion:curiosity:turn:request (only Hub can run the saga)
  -> every node transition: orion:durable:run:state -> sql-writer (substrate_durable_run_state)
                                                    -> Hub (completed + reach_out -> outreach)
                            + one attention-surface row (process=durable_run)
```

## Resume semantics

- A thread is unfinished when the compiled graph's state snapshot still has a
  `next` node. On boot and every `DURABLE_RUNS_RESUME_SWEEP_SEC` the runner re-invokes
  every such thread with `None` input; LangGraph continues from the next node with
  every earlier node's result intact.
- `harness_turn` is the one node whose *work* is not resumable: Hub runs an FCC
  subprocess. A restart mid-turn re-issues the turn (same `run_id`, `attempt+1`).
  Resume saves the daily-cap slot, the continuation, and everything after the turn --
  not the FCC minutes.
- A thread older than `DURABLE_RUNS_MAX_AGE_HOURS` is abandoned (one `abandoned` state
  event), never resumed into a different day's material.

## Deploy order (consumer-first, learned the hard way on 2026-09-06)

1. `orion-sql-writer` (new route/table + the `durable_run` value on `AttentionSchemaV1.process`)
2. this service
3. `orion-cortex-orch` (dispatch branch)
4. `orion-hub` with `HUB_CURIOSITY_KICKOFF_VIA_CORTEX=true`

`HUB_CURIOSITY_KICKOFF_VIA_CORTEX=false` (the default) keeps Hub's direct path exactly as
before; this service then receives nothing.
