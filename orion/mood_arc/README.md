# orion/mood_arc — felt-state-trajectory autoencoder

Offline research pipeline testing whether Orion has recurring **trajectory**
structure in its felt-state substrate — not just a single-tick `phi` value,
but a pattern across a *window* of ticks. It is a windowed autoencoder
trained over `field_channel_corpus.v1`'s raw, per-node/per-capability channel
pressures (`orion.schemas.telemetry.field_channel_corpus.FieldChannelCorpusRowV1`,
produced by `services/orion-field-digester`).

This is Item 2 (+3) of
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-felt-state-arc-roadmap-spec.md`. For the
full technical history — why the original corpus was invalidated, what was
tried and rejected, the real incidents this pipeline has already been through,
and the open design question blocking the rest of the roadmap — see
`orion/mood_arc/docs/DESIGN.md`. This README is the practical "how do I run
it" reference; the docs directory is the "why does it look like this" one.

**Status: dark deployment.** Everything here is an offline, manually-invoked
CLI. No bus publish, no service process, no container, no cognition consumer.
Registered `REHEARSAL` in `orion/inner_state_registry.py` (moved from
`orion/self_state/inner_state_registry.py` during the 2026-07-22 SelfStateV1
module deletion — path corrected here, no behavior change)
(`mood_arc_encoder.v1`, `mood_arc_corpus.v1`, `field_channel_corpus.v1`) —
that status is correct and intentional, not a gap to close as part of this
patch.

## What's in this module

- `fit_encoder.py` — the CLI. Two subcommands: `train` (fit a candidate
  encoder against a corpus slice) and `detect-anomalies` (score a corpus
  slice against an already-trained encoder). `promote` (item 2's eventual
  candidate → active promotion path) is not built yet.
- `tests/` — 33 tests covering windowing, field selection/pruning, the
  purged temporal split, the two-tier gate, the AR(1) surrogate, and the
  anomaly detector.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — the technical history and the open valence-replacement
  design question.

The corpus row schema (`FieldChannelCorpusRowV1`) and the manifest/anomaly
schemas (`MoodArcCorpusRowV1`, `MoodArcEncoderManifestV1`) stay in
`orion/schemas/telemetry/` — this module trains against them, it does not own
them, per this repo's shared-schema convention.

## Running `train`

Trains a shallow MLP autoencoder over flattened windows of the corpus, gated
by a two-tier check: a hard **floor** gate (must beat a within-window-shuffle
baseline by 2x — the falsifiable claim that the model learned real sequence
structure, not just per-tick statistics) and a diagnostic-only **ceiling**
comparison against an AR(1) surrogate (rules out "the encoder just relearned
the field-digester's own decay filter" — see `docs/DESIGN.md` for why that
check exists at all).

Current best-known-good configuration (validated 2026-07-18, see
`docs/DESIGN.md`'s "the real production run" section):

```bash
python orion/mood_arc/fit_encoder.py train \
  --corpus /mnt/telemetry/field_channels/corpus/field_channels.jsonl \
  --min-generated-at 2026-07-17T04:32:14Z \
  --hidden-dim 128 --latent-dim 64 \
  --epochs 250 \
  --out /tmp/mood-arc-encoders/v1-candidate
```

- `--min-generated-at 2026-07-17T04:32:14Z` is the first data-quality
  cutoff: rows before this timestamp reflect known-broken channel behavior
  from before a 7-PR fix sprint (PRs #1108-#1113, #1115). Training on the
  full unfiltered corpus produces contaminated field selection and fails the
  gate — see `docs/DESIGN.md`. This cutoff is also documented in
  `services/orion-field-digester/README.md`'s "`field_channel_corpus.v1`
  training-data quality cutoff" section; keep the two in sync if it's ever
  revised.
- **Second cutoff, `--min-generated-at 2026-07-22T04:35:01Z` (PR #1248,
  merged + deployed):** `transport_pressure`/`catalog_drift_pressure`/
  `observer_failure_pressure`/`reliability_pressure`/`contract_pressure`
  could get permanently stuck at a stale value (an `add`-mode perturbation
  bug in `services/orion-field-digester/app/ingest/state_deltas.py`, fixed
  in PR #1248, merged 2026-07-22T04:32:27Z, `orion-field-digester` restarted
  2026-07-22T04:35:01Z) — confirmed live as the cause of
  `catalog_drift_pressure` alone driving ~66% of average reconstruction
  error against `field_channel_anomaly.v2`. Unlike the first cutoff, this
  contamination window has no known start — `catalog_drift_pressure` was in
  fact stuck for the *entire* span of `v2`'s training corpus
  (2026-07-17T04:32:14Z-2026-07-22T01:30:24Z), confirmed by the fact that
  post-fix, with the real value correctly reading `0.0`, `v2` (trained on
  the stuck ~`0.135` reading) flipped to flagging the *correct* value as
  anomalous instead: `telemetry_anomaly` still fired 20 times in the 41
  minutes after the restart, same channel, opposite direction. **`v2` was
  not a valid baseline** — see the third cutoff below for what actually
  shipped as its replacement. If both cutoffs apply, use whichever is
  later.
- **Third cutoff, `--min-generated-at 2026-07-22T08:29:48Z` (PR #1262,
  merged + deployed):** two bugs in `orion/substrate/biometrics_loop`'s
  active-node-pressure reducer, upstream of this service. (1) `availability`
  one-way ratchet — a transient staleness blip could permanently flag a node
  unavailable, with no rule able to clear it; not one of `v2`'s 16 trained
  channels, but its exclusion from training was itself likely an artifact of
  this bug (permanently-stuck looks like no-signal). (2) merge-window dedup
  was a no-op across ticks — `node:atlas` accepted 767 "reinforce" deltas in
  2 hours instead of the ~24 a working 5-minute window should allow,
  inflating `pressure_score` and therefore `cpu_pressure` (`mode="add"`, one
  of `v2`'s 16 trained channels) via `active_node_pressure` deltas'
  `"strain"` pressure kind. See `services/orion-field-digester/README.md`'s
  "third training-data quality cutoff" section for the full detail.
  `2026-07-22T08:29:48Z` is `orion-substrate-runtime`'s restart time (the
  later of the two services this fix spans, and the binding one).
  Confirmed live: `node:atlas`'s `availability` recovered to `1.0`
  immediately post-restart, and its reinforce-delta rate dropped from
  ~1/9s to quiet within the first minute.

  **`v3` (currently deployed) trained against exactly this cutoff**:
  18,377 rows / 10.3h clean data, `floor_ratio=0.210` (pass, CI
  0.174-0.231), `ceiling_ratio=0.190` — within 0.001 of `v2`'s 0.189
  despite the much smaller/different corpus (an early n=2 signal this
  number may be stable, not yet the full multi-seed calibration the
  roadmap wants). `availability` survived field selection for the first
  time (`std=0.0398`), confirming its prior exclusion was the ratchet bug,
  not a real absence of signal. See `services/orion-field-digester/
  README.md`'s "Deployed model history" table for the full `v1`/`v2`/`v3`
  comparison.
- **Fourth cutoff, `--min-generated-at 2026-07-22T19:18:31Z` (commit
  `a98854a2` + PR #1267, both merged + deployed):** found while auditing
  chat/route prediction-error instruments — **`v3`, the currently deployed
  encoder, is also contaminated by this cutoff**, since `v3` trained on the
  third cutoff's window (2026-07-22T08:29:48Z onward), which predates this
  fix. `prediction_error` is confirmed as one of `v2`'s (and, by field
  selection carrying over, presumably `v3`'s) trained channels via
  `docs/DESIGN.md`'s "15 channels survived selection + pruning" list — a
  `max()`-merge across five nodes' shadow prediction-error instruments
  (`orion/substrate/prediction_error.py`, wired in `services/
  orion-substrate-runtime`). Two of those five were broken until today:
  `execution_prediction_error()`/`route_prediction_error()` matched on an
  exact `trace_id` that structurally never recurs (permanently `0.0`, fixed
  in `a98854a2`), and `chat_prediction_error()` skipped every brand-new turn
  (also permanently `0.0` in production despite 241 real accumulated chat
  turns, fixed in PR #1267). Confirmed directly against the training corpus
  file: its earliest available rows (2026-07-18T20:41Z) already read
  `prediction_error = 3e-323` — the `apply_decay()` floor a stale
  `NODE_DECAY_CHANNELS` entry settles to — consistent with this channel
  sitting at or near that floor for its entire history in this corpus,
  including throughout `v3`'s own training window, not carrying real
  learnable variance the way field selection presumably assumed.
  `2026-07-22T19:18:31Z` is `orion-substrate-runtime`'s restart time (the
  later of the two fixes' merges, both landing in that one service — the
  binding cutoff). Confirmed live post-restart, directly against the corpus
  file: rows minutes after read `prediction_error = 0.0671`-`0.1171`,
  varying across ticks rather than stuck at the old floor. See `services/
  orion-field-digester/README.md`'s "fourth training-data quality cutoff"
  section for the full detail, including the honest caveat that exact
  per-node attribution of the new reading hasn't been traced further.
  **A `v4` retrain against this cutoff would give `prediction_error` its
  first-ever real signal** (or whichever prior cutoff is later — currently
  this one); do not retrain yet, only minutes of clean data exist as of
  this writing. `v3` remains the right model to keep serving until then —
  it is not invalidated on the channels it actually gates on
  (`floor_ratio`/`ceiling_ratio` don't single out `prediction_error`), just
  carrying one contaminated-but-not-dominant input feature the same way
  `v2` carried `catalog_drift_pressure` before the second cutoff.
- **Fifth cutoff, `--min-generated-at 2026-07-23T06:10:08Z` (commit `5b1cc0fa`, merged +
  deployed):** found while checking whether the FCC-motor signal bundle
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-fcc-motor-field-digester-signals-design.md`) endangered
  `v3` — its 5 brand-new channels don't (confirmed: `app/anomaly_scorer.py`'s `score_latest()`
  selects strictly by `self._manifest.channel_names`, and `build_windows()` defaults any field
  not present in a row to `0.0` by design — a genuinely new channel name is silently ignored,
  not a contamination risk). But two of `v3`'s own 15 *trained* channels were live-changed by
  that same investigation's fix: `execution_load` (`min(1.0, started_step_count/8.0)` over a
  blended cortex-exec+harness-governor counter, hard-capped) and `reasoning_load` (a boolean
  `0.35`/`0.05` wearing a magnitude's name) both replaced with real, continuously-varying
  formulas — see `services/orion-field-digester/README.md`'s entries for the full mechanism.
  `v3` was trained on the *old* distributions for both. Every score computed since
  `orion-field-digester`'s `2026-07-23T06:10:08Z` restart compares new-distribution live data
  against a stale-distribution-trained model — the same contamination class as cutoffs two
  through four. **Resolved 2026-07-24**: exactly 2 `field_channel_anomaly_flagged` events
  fired, both 11-14 minutes post-restart, none since (re-checked at 11+ hours post-restart).
  Timing matches `app/anomaly_scorer.py`'s own documented cold-start artifact (reconcile-seeded
  defaults still in the buffer right after a restart), not a sustained distribution-shift
  problem — a real shift would keep firing as the new formulas kept flowing, not fire twice and
  go silent. Read as noise. **Second shift on `reasoning_load` the same day (2026-07-24)**:
  the FCC-motor/harness-governor path gained its own real magnitude too
  (`reasoning_output_tokens`, real provider token counts from the FCC CLI's own result-event
  usage object — previously that path had no magnitude at all, always the `0.35`/`0.05` flag).
  Same cutoff timestamp already covers it (no new cutoff needed), but noted here since it's a
  second, later change to an already-cutoff channel, not just the one `5b1cc0fa` fix. **Do not
  retrain yet** — matching every prior cutoff's own caveat, only minutes of clean post-fix data
  exist as of this writing. `v3` remains the model to keep serving until a `v4` retrain against
  this cutoff (or whichever is later) is warranted.
  **Heads-up for whoever eventually renames `transport_pressure`** (flagged as a live
  scope-honesty issue below, and in that same FCC-motor design doc's appendix, but not yet
  fixed): `transport_pressure` is also one of `v3`'s 15 trained channels. A rename is a
  *different* failure mode than this cutoff's distribution shift — the encoder would find the
  field genuinely absent by name and silently default it to `0.0` (per `build_windows()`'s
  missing-field convention) rather than see a shifted distribution — but it is still a
  cutoff-class event for `v3`, not the "safe, no-training-impact" rename it might look like at
  a glance. Treat it as a sixth cutoff when it ships.
- **Scope caveat on `prediction_error`'s "transport" contributor (found 2026-07-22, not a new
  cutoff — no code changed, just what the channel actually means):** `prediction_error` is a
  `max()`-merge across five nodes; one of them, `node:substrate.transport`, is fed entirely by
  whatever streams `orion-bus`'s bus-observer role watches (`BUS_OBSERVER_STREAMS`,
  `services/orion-bus/.env_example`) — currently `orion:stream:world_pulse:run:result` and its
  DLQ, **the only two real Redis Streams anywhere in the architecture** (everything else is
  pub/sub, which has no depth/backlog concept to measure). This is not general bus/transport
  health across services, despite the name — it's whether one specific service's result queue
  backs up. Confirmed live: that queue has sat at a constant 91 messages for the entire
  post-second-cutoff corpus window (zero variance) — **not** an unconsumed backlog (corrected
  2026-07-23: `XINFO GROUPS` shows the real consumer group at `pending=0, lag=0`, fully caught
  up; the Stream is simply never trimmed, so `XLEN` reflects lifetime message count since
  2026-07-07, not a depth). Either way, this contributor to the merge is essentially always the
  smallest/least-surprising of the five, structurally, not because transport is calm. See
  `services/orion-substrate-runtime/README.md`'s "transport domain is one queue" note for the
  full trace, including this correction and the redesign now in progress
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-transport-domain-rpc-health-redesign.md`, PR #1290) —
  not yet wired to feed `prediction_error` or any mood-arc training channel; flagged here so a
  future retrain's field-selection results for `prediction_error` aren't misread as "the whole
  bus is healthy" when they're really "one queue is quiet, structurally the only thing that can
  ever show up here."
- **`catalog_drift_pressure` is now a structurally dead channel going forward (found
  2026-07-23):** unlike `prediction_error`, this one is an actual member of `v2`'s (and
  presumably `v3`'s) 15 selected channels. It counts streams the bus-observer watches that
  aren't in `orion/bus/channels.yaml`'s catalog — since the same 2026-07-18 fix above made the
  observer only ever watch cataloged streams, that count, and this channel, is now permanently
  `0.0` by construction, not by observation (confirmed `MISSING` from every recent corpus row —
  the `PRESSURE_CHANNELS`/`value > 0` inclusion gate no longer lets it through at all). A future
  retrain's field-selection pass will likely drop it outright; worth noting in the retrain
  writeup as an expected, not anomalous, absence. Full detail:
  `services/orion-field-digester/README.md`'s `catalog_drift_pressure` channel-catalog entry.
- `--hidden-dim 128 --latent-dim 64` are the defaults as of this patch
  (`DEFAULT_HIDDEN_DIM`/`DEFAULT_LATENT_DIM` in `fit_encoder.py`) — sized for
  `field_channel_corpus.v1`'s ~16-26-channel width, not the old 4-channel
  corpus's 32/16.
- `--epochs 250` is also the current default (`DEFAULT_EPOCHS`) — changed
  down from 500 after a 2026-07-18 overfitting incident, see
  `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- Correlation pruning (`prune_correlated_fields()`, `--corr-threshold 0.9` by
  default) runs automatically after field selection — no flag needed to
  enable it.

Every `train` run writes `manifest.json` / `weights.npz` / `probes.json`
under `--out`. `probes.json` is intentionally empty right now —
`compute_window_probes()` raises `NotImplementedError` rather than guessing a
replacement for the old `valence` probe target (see `docs/DESIGN.md`'s open
question section). `cmd_train` catches this and writes the empty file with a
clear skip message; this is not a bug.

## Running `detect-anomalies`

Scores a corpus slice's reconstruction loss against an already-trained
encoder and flags windows whose loss exceeds
`manifest.training.recon_error_p95 * --threshold-multiplier` (default `3.0`).

```bash
python orion/mood_arc/fit_encoder.py detect-anomalies \
  --corpus /mnt/telemetry/field_channels/corpus/field_channels.jsonl \
  --encoder-dir /tmp/mood-arc-encoders/v1-candidate \
  --min-generated-at 2026-07-13T23:46:00Z \
  --max-generated-at 2026-07-17T04:32:14Z
```

`--min-generated-at`/`--max-generated-at` scope scoring to a specific
historical window independently of the encoder's own training window — the
example above scores the known pre-fix period against the production
encoder (see `docs/DESIGN.md`'s "the anomaly detector" section for the real
result of running exactly this).

**`detect-anomalies` is currently a dark deployment: a manual CLI tool
only.** Nothing runs it automatically — no scheduled job, no bus channel, no
live cognition consumer reads its output. Practical uses today:

1. **A pre-training QA gate** — before training on a new corpus slice, score
   it against a known-good encoder to catch contamination before wasting a
   training run on it.
2. **Retrospective incident scoring** — given a suspected-bad time period,
   get a quantified anomaly rate instead of eyeballing logs.

If it needs to run automatically or feed a live consumer, that's unbuilt
follow-on work (a scheduler + a destination for the output), not something
this patch does.

## Semantic taxonomy of the channels

The 29 raw channels `field_channel_corpus.v1` carries (and the 15-16 that
typically survive selection/pruning) have a real-world-meaning grouping
already written up in
`services/orion-field-digester/README.md`'s `### Semantic categories`
section. That is the canonical reference — this module links to it rather
than duplicating it, since the taxonomy applies to the corpus/channel
producer, not to this training pipeline specifically.
