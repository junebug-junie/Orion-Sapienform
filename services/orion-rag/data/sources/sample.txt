RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a pattern where a language model retrieves
relevant context from external data (documents, knowledge bases, etc.) and then uses that
context to generate an answer. This helps the model stay grounded in factual, up-to-date,
and organization-specific information without retraining the model itself.

Key benefits:
- Answers are supported by retrieved passages (“citations”).
- You can update or replace the document store without retraining.
- Smaller local models can punch above their weight when given good context.
