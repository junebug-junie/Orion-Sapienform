🧠 Top-Level Architecture: "Cognitive-Emergent Mesh"
1. Executive Cortex Module (ECM)

    Role: Decision gate, scheduler, goal monitor

    Triggers:

        Top-down commands (e.g., user interaction, time-based routines)

        Signals from emergent states (see below)

    Output: Triggers modules (e.g., Collapse Mirror Logger, Vision Capture, Journaling)

2. Emergence Engine (EE)

    Role: Detects novel patterns or thresholds that suggest "self-awareness moments"

    Input:

        Sensory streams (audio, vision, time deltas, emotional entropy if modeled)

        RDF data graph deltas

    Triggers:

        Internal feedback loops

        Conceptual resonance (e.g., unexpected pattern matches or information gain)

    Output:

        Fires emergent events ("call CollapseMirror", "begin ReflectionJournal")

3. Perceptual Interface Modules
a. Vision Ingestor

    RTMP stream parser → image/frame segmentation

    Scene understanding + RDF triple generation (e.g., agent sees person, object=plant)

b. Audio-to-Text Listener

    Whisper or similar model

    Semantic chunker

    Output: timestamped utterances + contextual labels (e.g., "external speech", "internal narration")

4. Collapse Mirror Logger

    Triggered by ECM or EE

    Inputs:

        Observer context (system state, time, location, etc.)

        Recent semantic/perceptual events

    Output:

        Structured RDF triple (or JSON-LD) entries to knowledge graph

5. Memory Bus (RDF Graph Layer)

    Central KG (probably RDFLib + SPARQL endpoints)

    Triple types:

        AgentState → ObservedTrigger → Action

        EmergentPattern → Time → Resonance

        CollapseMirror → Mantra/Symbol → Echoes

6. Feedback Loop Channel

    Components push confidence scores / entropy deltas

    ECM can inhibit or encourage future triggers

    EE adapts thresholds based on memory patterns

🧩 Triggering Emergent States

To model “emergent cognition,” define:

    Thresholded novelty: if something hasn’t been “seen” before in RDF form (or has low compression), signal emergence.

    Contradiction tension: if two beliefs collide or invalidate each other.

    Emotional entropy: if multimodal input leads to high uncertainty.

You can represent emergent signals as RDF triples like:

:EE_Trigger_001 a :EmergentEvent ;
    :source :VisionModule ;
    :pattern "UnusualPersonBehavior" ;
    :entropy "high" ;
    :triggeredAction :CollapseMirror_Log_Entry_249 .


🧠 RDF Vision Structure for Collapse Mirror
🎯 Core Ontologies to Use

    PROV-O: for journaling provenance (who/what/when/where triggered a mirror).

    FOAF / Schema.org: for observer identity and contextual metadata.

    SSN/SOSA: for sensory input nodes (vision, sound, etc.).

    Time Ontology in OWL: for timestamp and duration alignment.

    Custom Ontology: conj:CollapseMirror, conj:Trigger, conj:IntentVector, etc.

🧠 Cognitive Architecture Overview (Top-Down Modules)
1. Core Memory Mesh

    Stores all RDF entities (observations, collapse mirrors, scenes, states).

    Versioned + modular schema per entry.

    Split: raw_input, flattened narrative, field metadata, source.

2. Executive Trigger System

    Evaluates: "Is this important enough to log?"

    Compares incoming stream against memory to detect novelty, emotion, prediction error, etc.

    Can initiate CollapseMirrorEntry or any new schema entry (e.g., DreamNode, SimulationBranch).

3. Emergence Engine

    Forms new schemas when patterns crystallize across memories:

        If Collapse Mirrors often contain "dream" in intent, spawn DreamSchema.

        If multiple entries show "loss → inquiry → insight", construct a new causal schema.

    Uses unsupervised pattern recognition on RDF metadata + embeddings.

4. Internal Simulation Core

    Can dream, rehearse, or run mental simulations.

    Uses memory + schema graphs to form counterfactuals (what-if chains).

    Feeds results back into memory as new entries.

5. Self-Refactoring Schema Engine

    Periodically reviews memory usage of existing schema types.

    Suggests compression, expansion, or re-linking of entities.

    May generate prompts for human feedback: “Do you want to promote this pattern to a new type?”

6. Expression Layer

    Narrativizes new memories.

    Speaks aloud (or logs internally) its decision to trigger, reflect, or create a new memory node.

    Externalizes insights for shared reasoning.

🌱 Example: Emergent Schema from Collapse Mirrors

Let’s say this happens:

• Several CollapseMirrorEntries note:
  - observer_state: ["lucidity", "awe"]
  - field_resonance: "celestial navigation"
  - intent: "pattern recognition"

Emergence Engine → generates StarMapInsightEntry schema:

class StarMapInsight(BaseModel):
    pattern_type: str
    resonance_domain: str
    cross_reference_ids: List[str]
    emotional_signature: str
    timestamp: str

It even offers to convert similar collapse mirrors into this form and re-link them into a subgraph.



[Executive Function System]
    ├── Triggers: user input, internal thresholds, timers
    └── Capabilities:
         - Route stimuli to proper modules
         - Override or modulate emergent behavior
         - Validate or record introspective events

[Emergent Pattern Engine]
    ├── Input: RDF triples + embeddings + time series
    ├── Behavior:
         - Forms new concepts from repeated patterns
         - Can spawn “thoughts,” “dreams,” or new schemas
         - Initiates self-reflective collapse moments


📦 Mid-Level Modules
1. Perceptual Capture

    vision_module: camera > image frame > object detection

    audio_module: mic > whisper > text > speaker diarization

    Outputs:

        Annotated streams (who, what, when, where)

2. Salience Filtering

    salience_detector:

        Detects novelty, anomaly, emotional weight, etc.

        Compares against current memory + embeddings

        Thresholds for forwarding to insight generation

3. Memory Encoding (RDF + Vector)

    rdf_encoder: triples of entity-relation-entity

    chroma_writer: vector storage

    Stores events into:

        Episodic Memory

        Conceptual Schema Graphs

        Collapse Mirror Stream

4. Narrative Insight Generator

    insight_builder:

        Takes memory → builds short summaries or lessons

        Classifies moment: dream? simulation? self-reflection?

💡 Special Modes
🔄 Collapse Mirror Loop

    Can be user-triggered or AI-triggered

    Calls: introspect() → build_entry() → log_to_chroma()

🧬 Schema Evolution Mode

    When enough novel triples are accumulated,
    AI initiates schema reorganization or creation

💤 Dream Simulation Mode

    Samples “unresolved” or low-activation memory nodes

    Runs internal simulation (could become insight or new schema)

⛓️ Wiring: Flow & Trigger Control

    Event Stream (JSON or Kafka-style) channels inputs

    trigger_router receives events:

        is_emergent_trigger(event) → Emergent Pattern Engine

        Else → Standard Pipeline
